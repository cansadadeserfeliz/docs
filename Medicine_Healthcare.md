In the 1980s and 1990s, many food manufacturers reduced the fat content 
in processed food products and instead added more sugar. 
Families tended to eat fewer meals at home. 
Total calorie intake, sugar consumption, and processed food consumption have 
all tended to rise, while physical activity has tended to decrease. 
Our bodies are adapted to store calories. With increasing calorie consumption, 
this adaptation is maladaptive, increasing risks for obesity and diabetes.

Fat contains about 9 calories per gram, while carbohydrates and proteins 
contain about 4 calories per gram each. All three of these macronutrients 
can be stored by the body as fat (adipose tissue). 
These macronutrients are commonly found in foods (though in different proportions). 
Eliminating a single nutrient is not likely a sustainable solution - we eat foods, 
not nutrients in isolation.

Humans need three macronutrients to survive.

## Carbohydrate-rich Foods

**Гликемический индекс** (glycemic (glycaemic) index, сокращённо GI) — показатель 
влияния продуктов питания после их употребления на уровень сахара в крови. 
Гликемический индекс (ГИ) является отражением сравнения реакции организма 
на продукт с реакцией организма на чистую глюкозу, у которой ГИ равен 100.

Whole grains (like brown rice and quinoa) tend to have a lower glycemic index 
than refined foods (like white bread). High glycemic index foods tend to lead 
to rapid release of glucose into the bloodstream and an insulin spike to lower 
blood glucose levels. This leads to unstable levels of blood glucose, 
earlier return of hunger, and a tendency to overeat. 
In contrast, low glycemic index foods (which tend to have higher amounts of fiber) 
lead to a slower release of glucose into the bloodstream, 
a less extreme release of insulin, and more stable blood sugar levels.

## Animal & Plant-based Proteins. Amino Acids

Our body can produce many amino acids, but some must be supplemented through the diet. 
Though *animal sources of protein tend to be complete* (providing all essential amino acids), 
*they also tend to be sources of fat* (and can include saturated fat). 
Thus, plant sources of protein tend to be overall healthier sources of protein - 
especially when multiple plant sources of protein are combined, 
as in many global food traditions.

- lean tissue;
- cell signaling;
- hormonal proteins;
- immune function;
- cellular structure;

Proteins act as building blocks for lean tissues in our bodies.

## Fats

- energy storadge;
- insulation;
- brain development;
- protection of internal organs;

Dietary fats: saturated fats (animal fats: lard and butter) 
and unsaturated fats (omega 3, fish oil, nuts, avocados, flax seeds, vegetable oils).

A good dietary recommendation about fat intake is to choose foods with 
naturally occurring unsaturated fats, *reduce consumption of saturated fats*, 
and *eliminate trans fats*. 
Omega 3 is an essential fatty acid found in fish oil, nuts, flaxseed, 
and some other vegetable oils. In general, white meats tend to be leaner 
in that they contain lower levels of saturated fat compared to red meats. 
A recommendation to eat a plant-based fat whenever eating an animal product 
would not decrease consumption of saturated fats and may lead to an inappropriately 
high level of fat in the diet - it is not the best recommendation here.

Unsaturated fats, like healthier vegetable oils, tend to be liquids at room temperature. 
The human body cannot make all essential fatty acids (such as Omega 3). 
Some *unsaturated fats* (in processed foods) have unstable chemical bonds that create *trans fats*, 
which tend to lower HDL cholesterol (good cholesterol) while raising LDL cholesterol (bad cholesterol). 
Saturated fats can raise LDL cholesterol but have not been shown to reduce HDL cholesterol 
as significantly as trans fats.

**Nutrient density** refers to the concept of looking at the nutritional value of a food divided by its energy content (or total calories). It does not consider food cost. Highly processed foods tend to have a large amount of calories with relatively little nutritional value (and are thus not very nutrient dense). In comparison, a fresh, whole food like spinach tends to be low in calories but high in nutritional value, making it very nutrient dense.

Removing certain nutrients from foods during extensive processing decreases nutrient content and prevents foods from spoiling quickly, thus extending shelf life. Processed foods tend to have a higher added salt, fat, and sugar content to make them attractive to the consumer.
